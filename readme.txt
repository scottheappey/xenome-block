Make the unfamiliar familiar – Educate, empower and listen to your audience through bite-sized pieces of information and clever feedback mechanisms.

== Description ==

How it works – More experiential than a poll, more engaging than a survey.

Create faster, design better – Getting started is easy! Simply choose your base settings then build out each section using quick selections – a multiple-choice answer generator. Then upload your own background media or search Pexels for stock imagery.

Distribute smarter, reach further – Enhance your website with embedded content.

Analyse in context, present with impact. Receive your results in real-time and present them in a format that both presents the data and tells a story.
